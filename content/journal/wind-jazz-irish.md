As usual, college has consumed most of my life for the past several months. It has been a good, but busy semester packed with programming, music and cooking (alright, not that much cooking, but it's the thought that counts). This past weekend, I traveled with the Pitt Band to South Bend where our [Panthers](http://www.pittsburghpanthers.com/sports/m-footbl/pitt-m-footbl-body.html) took on the [Fighting Irish](http://www.und.com/sports/m-footbl/nd-m-footbl-body.html). It was an exciting game to say the least, but more on that later.

On Friday, we had some time to explore Chicago. I have been to the city on several different occasions, but there is always something new to discover. After [walking](/uploads/2012/615658_10152261519240525_1009366805_o.jpg) for a mile or so along the lake, we grabbed some lunch at [Navy Pier](http://www.navypier.com/). On our way back, we stopped in Millennium [Park](/uploads/2012/281047_10152261525375525_18587130_o.jpg) to check out Chicago's iconic attractions. During our tour, I had [loads](/uploads/2012/175557_10152261527375525_1491482926_o.jpg) [of](/uploads/2012/133354_10152261526910525_2071807541_o.jpg) [fun](/uploads/2012/178158_10152261525185525_560015229_o.jpg) playing around with my friend's camera. On Friday night, some friends and I had the opportunity to hear [Barry Harris](http://www.barryharris.com/) play with the [Columbia College](http://www.colum.edu/) Big Band at a local [jazz club](http://www.jazzshowcase.com/). We enjoyed every minute â€“ there is really nothing like live music.

Saturday was an early morning as we made our way to South Bend for some [old school](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre_Dame_Stadium) football. After quite an [unpredictable](http://www.pittsburghpanthers.com/sports/m-footbl/recaps/100512aaa.html) [season](http://www.pittsburghpanthers.com/sports/m-footbl/recaps/091512aaa.html), nobody really knew what to expect from the Panthers. However, No. 3 Notre Dame was sure to put up a fight. Throughout the first half, Pittsburgh opened a lead by taking advantage of Notre Dame's mistakes. And with a 20-6 lead over the Irish at the beginning of the fourth quarter, things were looking good for the Panthers. In the end, after three overtimes, a missed field goal attempt and some [luck](http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/colleges/notre-dame-catches-break-when-officials-didnt-notice-irish-used-2-no-2s-on-missed-pitt-fg/2012/11/04/025e567a-26c4-11e2-ac64-5d52a2c5953e_story.html) from the Irish, Notre Dame pulled out a win. Despite the final score, it was by far the most exciting game of college football I have ever seen.
