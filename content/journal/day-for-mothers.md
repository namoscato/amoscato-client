There are a lot of holidays out there that have lost their original focus. Take Halloween, for example. The holiday is typically traced back to Gaelic harvest festival [Samhain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samhain) and Christian [All Saint's Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Saints%27_Day). However, over the years, rituals remembering the dead and services honoring the saints have turned into an expensive [sugar fest](http://moneyland.time.com/2011/09/29/now-thats-creepy-americans-will-blow-7-billion-on-halloween/). Then there is Thanksgiving which is tainted by its subsequent counterpart. In fact, stores don't even wait until Thanksgiving is over anymore to start their Black Friday [deals](http://www.bgr.com/2011/11/28/black-friday-2011-spending-sets-new-record/). The commercialization of Christmas can go without saying, and I'm not going to get started on Valentine's Day.

With all of that said, I don't think Mother's Day has fallen into the commercial trapâ€”at least not for me. I'm sure it has for some people, but I am determined to prevent that from happening. For me, Mother's Day has always been a pure, family-oriented holiday that reminds me how fortunate I am to have such an incredible role model in my life. As life goes on, I realize that there were times when I had taken her for granted, but I can always count on Mother's Day for getting me back on track. This year, my sister and I had a great time making a small [token](http://albums.amoscato.com/Mother'sDay12/) of appreciation for our mother.

To all of the mothers out there, I hope your day was special. You deserve it.
