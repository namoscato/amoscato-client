I was in New York City a couple of weekends ago for my cousin's wedding. While I was there, I was fortunate to make it down to the [National September 11 Memorial](http://www.911memorial.org/). It was a moving experience and quite a [sight](/uploads/2012/nine_eleven_pan.jpg) to see. They do still have a fair amount of construction to complete, but after ten years, I'm glad they have something to honor those that lost their lives on that tragic day.

Shortly after my visit to New York, I saw Stephen Daldry's film _[Extremely Loud & Incredible Close](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0477302/)_. The movie is about a brilliant nine-year-old who searches the Big Apple for a lock that matches a key left behind by his father, who died in the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. I would definitely recommend the film.

Last weekend I made it down to the second annual [Pittsburgh Jazz Live International](http://pittsburghjazzlive.com/). I heard some great artists last year and was so excited I would be able to catch some music this year as well. From [Sean Jones](http://seanjonesmusic.com/) to [Poogie Bell](http://www.poogiebell.net/) and Chris Hemingway, it was certainly a day to remember. I even got to hear a young group, [Center of Life](http://www.centeroflife.net/col-jazz), that recently [won](http://www.montereyjazzfestival.org/2012/ngjf/2012-next-generation-jazz-festival-top-groups) first place at the Next Generation Jazz Festival in Monterey, CA.

Last Wednesday, I saw [Jenn Bostic](http://jennbostic.com/) and [Connie Lim](http://connielimmusic.com/) play a small concert over at the [Christine Fr√©chard Gallery](http://www.christinefrechardgallery.com/) in Shadyside. The concert was really great. The independent artists have been touring together, and I have to say, I was impressed. They are two of the most talented female singers I have ever heard. They have loads of potential, and I can't wait to see where they end up in five or ten years.

I finally made it down to the [Three Rivers Arts Festival](http://www.3riversartsfest.org/) today and had a great time looking at art and listening to music. The [River City Brass](http://www.rivercitybrass.org/) band put on a great concert and we had a delicious [lunch](http://www.foodspotting.com/reviews/1876671) at [Winghart's](http://winghartburgers.com/). Overall it was a great day in Pittsburgh.

I'm making every effort to make the most of summer. Here's to the sunny days in the 'burgh.
