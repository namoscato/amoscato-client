Friday we had free time until about 4pm. It was a much needed breather from the busy itinerary we have had to go through thus far. After a leisurely morning at the hotel which involved (relatively) sleeping in and eating breakfast, a few of us went on a run down the the old city. We had traveled the path last night, but it was definitely different during the day. Luckily it wasn’t too hot yet in the morning.

Once we made it down to the old city, we grabbed some pizza for lunch before exploring the various shops inside the city walls. Its a really cool atmosphere inside of the walls — the streets are really narrow, and you really feel like you’re in a different world.

As some of us were carrying some bags, we walked back to the hotel and spent a solid couple of hours at the beach. It’s actually been a while since I’ve been to a beach, so it was a lot of fun. I didn’t know we were even going to a beach on this trip, so I had to borrow someone’s athletic shorts. The alternative was close to a $100 swim suit I found in the old city. That wasn’t going to happen.

The beach was actually pretty rocky; it almost hurt to walk close to the water. The water was calm and cold, but once you got in, it wasn’t so bad. Overall a solid day at the beach.

Around 4pm we boarded the buses which took us over to Kotor. There, the choir briefly rehearsed in St. Nicholas’ Orthodox Cathedral before a concert that night. We had a quick dinner at a bakery in the town before the concert.

The concert went really really well. The general consensus was that it was definitely one of the best performances they had sung over the course of several years.
