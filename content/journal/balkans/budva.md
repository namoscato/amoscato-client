Thursday was another relatively long day of traveling on the bus. We had some breakfast at the hotel in Tirana before making our way to Montenegro. Although before we arrived, we made what was supposed to be a quick stop for lunch in Shkoder, Albania. We ended up all going to to a San Francisco restaurant — and you can imagine what happens when fifty some people arrive at the same restaurant. Either way, the food alright and we finished up in a half hour or so.

The ride to Budva was incredible — just as good as the ride along the Amalfi coast in Italy. The Adriatic is so clear, and there’s nothing quite like houses and buildings on steep cliffs overlooking water.

After arriving in Budva, we had a little free time at the hotel before heading down to the old town for dinner. The old town was just down the street from the hotel — apparently only a half hour walk along the water. I was definitely looking forward to making that happen later.

We had really tasty fish for dinner. This time, the meat was already off the bone, so we just had to eat it normally. We had some ice cream/gelato for dessert. After dinner, a few of us stayed down near old town which is surrounded by a brick fortress. The narrow streets inside resemble some sort of maze with lots of shops and restaurants.

We found a cool bar to chill at after walking around, and enjoyed the walk along the water back to the hotel.
