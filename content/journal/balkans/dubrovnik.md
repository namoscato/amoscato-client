Saturday morning we had a relatively early breakfast at the hotel before departing for Dubrovnik. The ride was relatively uneventful aside from traveling on a large “taxi” boat that transported our bus and us all over to the other side of a body of water.

Upon arriving in Dubrovnik, we were dropped off at the old city where we had some time for lunch before taking a guided tour of the city walls. Actually the guided tour was optional, so a few of us decided to bag the tour and explore the walls ourselves. The thought was that we wouldn’t really remember most of thee information presented on the tour anyways and we wanted some freedom to explore at our own pace. I heard the tour went well, but either way, the views along the city walls were incredible. The combination of the blaring sun and extensive walking really tired us out.

After walking the walls, we had some time to grab food (and no doubt get some gelato — that seemed to be a recurring activity during the last couple of days). We then were bused back to the hotel which was only about a five minute ride down the street.

After checking into the hotel, I took a taxi down to the old town with a few people to go to church at 6pm. We had a little bit of free time after mass before the rest of the choir was bused down to the old town for dinner. The dinner was incredible. So much food. Apparently it was one of the several personal gifts the chancellor gave us.

After dinner, most of the choir was bused back to the hotel, but I opted to walk back with a few people. It was only a twenty minute walk or so, and it was nice to try to digest some of the food we had tonight.
