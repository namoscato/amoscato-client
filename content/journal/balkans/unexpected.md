I got a call from Mr. Goldsmith on Sunday night. He told me that one of the guys in Heinz Chapel Choir could not go on the trip and at the last minute, and he invited me to come along. Honestly, I’m still trying to process everything — things happened so fast! But for whatever reason, here I am: about to embark on a two week tour through Eastern Europe. I am so grateful for this unbelievable opportunity.

To be clear, I’m not singing. Which certainly confuses the matter of why I was even invited on this trip in the first place. But I am hopeful that no less then 1,000,000 “thank you’s” will begin to express my gratitude.

Also, I did not bring a computer — I am writing this on a tablet. So expect relatively infrequent, brief posts with spelling errors and whatnot. This also means that I wont be posting photos while on the trip. I’ll hopefully be taking lots of pictures though — I just bought a couple of pretty big SD cards, so I am all set to take thousand of photos.

We’re flying out of DC later tonight and have a layover in Germany before arriving in Bulgaria. See you on the other side!
