Before I put this blog to rest, I wanted to post some links to a few photo albums and the audio recording of the last concert in Bosnia. I came back with just under 4,000 photos. It took several full days to go through all of them, and they ended up in a couple albums on Facebook. If you’re interested, you can check out [Part I](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10152142611598333.1073741827.616778332&type=1&l=742d7e3f7b) and [Part II](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10152143553343333.1073741828.616778332&type=1&l=64712371ff).

I also uploaded a [recording](https://soundcloud.com/namoscato/sets/hcc-2014-concert-tour) of the last concert in Bosnia to SoundCloud. It’s not the best quality (it was taken on an iPhone in the middle of the audience), but it is certainly better than nothing!

It has been almost a week since I have been back, and I really do miss Eastern Europe. It was such a great trip. Until next time!
