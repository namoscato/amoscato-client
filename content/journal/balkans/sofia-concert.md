Thursday evening was the first concert in the tour at a Catholic church in Sofia. There was a quick rehearsal earlier in the day, and from the sounds of it, I knew it was going to be an awesome concert.

I have heard Heinz Chapel choir throughout my four years at Pitt, but I was unable to make their spring concert this past semester, so I was really looking forward to hearing them tonight.

As expected, the concert was awesome. And the place was packed. Everyone in the audience clearly enjoyed the concert as well â€” they even gave a standing ovation at the end, which I am told does not typically in happen in Europe.
