Believe it or not, I ran into Don Charlton (the CEO and founder of The Resumator — the company I will be working at in a few weeks) at the Dulles airport. It is certainly a small world. Random meetings aside though, we had a very uneventful experience at the airport and departed for Germany on time.

The flight was pretty smooth as well — no complaints. I had a nice chicken dinner while watching the first movie in the Bourne trilogy. I tried to catch some sleep, but you know how well that goes on a plane.

We arrived in the Frankfort airport around 9am in the morning (their time; 3am Eastern Time) and had about an hour layover before our quick two hour flight to Sofia, Bulgaria. Before we left, I was sure to grab a quick espresso — hoping for something that would wake me up.

We arrived in Bulgaria at about 2pm and took a short bus ride to our hotel. Looking forward to exploring before dinner tonight!
