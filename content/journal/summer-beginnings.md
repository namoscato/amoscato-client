Monday marked my first day as a software engineer intern at [The Resumator](http://www.theresumator.com/). The past week marked the beginnings of what I know is going to be an incredible summer. In only five days, I have learned a lot and already saw my code being pushed into production. I feel privileged to be working with such a talented [group](http://www.theresumator.com/about-us) of people, and I can honestly say that I look forward to work.

Even though I thoroughly enjoy my job, full-time work definitely makes me appreciate the weekends. I spent most of today down in Point State Park for Pittsburgh's [Venture Outdoors](http://www.ventureoutdoors.org/) Festival. I enjoyed several hours of [kayaking](http://instagr.am/p/K0KMOfFZNe/), mountain climbing, yoga and biking. Tomorrow I am psyched to see [Blue Man Group](http://www.blueman.com/) over at the Benedum. And while were on the subject, I saw [Kurt Elling](http://kurtelling.com/) put on a great show last weekend at [MCG Jazz](http://mcgjazz.org/).

Overall, it's been a great start to the summer. I'm looking forward to making the most of every day.
