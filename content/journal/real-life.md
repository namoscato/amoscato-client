Well, tomorrow I begin real life – or at least that is what they seem to call it. But what does that make the past twenty some years of my life? Were they fake? I hope not. It would be pretty depressing if the life I have been leading was fictitious.

Real life, though. What does that even mean? Is it the transition from a paying student to a paid employee? Perhaps. But I think that depends on one's definition of _student_. To be clear, I fully intend to continue learning despite the completion of my "formal" education – you know, the past seventeen years of schooling from elementary to middle, high school through college. Good times.

Alright, before you freak out because of what could be considered a sarcastic comment ridiculing our education system, calm down. Sure, there was a little sarcasm in there, but you have to understand where I am coming from. I have been in school for the past seventeen years of my life. Now, I am making it seem like a bad experience and that was certainly not the case. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at [North Allegheny](http://www.northallegheny.org/) and the [University of Pittsburgh](http://www.pitt.edu/). It's just time to move on.

But back to the meaning of “real life”. Perhaps it has something to do with the change in expected responsibility. I feel like in some cases, one's status as a student is used as an excuse for irresponsibility. I don't mean to say that I have been personally irresponsible, but there's something to be said about the comfort of a student in which one is expected to fulfill the predefined requirements. And by requirements, I am referring to a relatively broad set of conditions. Obvious example: attend a four-year college. Seriously, everyone does it nowadays – even if you don't know what the heck you want to do with your life. But I don't want to get too sidetracked, so I'll save that conversation for another day.

Point being: real life does not have a predefined set of requirements. There is no graduation progress report that lets you know how you are doing in your career path through life. I have to be honest, I am a bit nervous about that aspect in particular, but I'm convinced that is normal. All I can hope for is that I will know what to do when presented with a challenge, and I will be able to make the best choice for that point in my life. Honestly, as long as I am learning with a talented group of people who are collectively working on an interesting problem, I am going to be happy.

At this point in my life, the best choice was to stay in Pittsburgh and return to [The Resumator](https://www.theresumator.com/), a mid-size startup company that aims to bring together talented professionals and compelling companies via their applicant tracking system and recruiting software. A lot has changed at The Resumator since I [interned](http://amoscato.com/journal/2012/summer-internship/) with them two summers ago. They now have some fifteen engineers on the team, and they recently opened a marketing/sales office in San Francisco. I could not be more excited to get back to working with them!

One of my goals as I begin the next phase of my life involves regular blogging. I think part of the problem has to do with the fact that I have [several](http://italy.amoscato.com/) [distinct](http://amoscato.com/journal/smartling/) [blogs](http://amoscato.com/journal/balkans/) that make it difficult to aggregate. Ideally, I would like to try and merge these into a central blog with different topics/categories, but I think that's easier said than done. I would like to do a lot of things – including a complete redesign of this site. But there is only so much time in the day.

At any rate, here's to living a life that is led by nothing but one's wildest imaginations. Things are about to get real.
