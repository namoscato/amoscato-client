I had a really interesting discussion with [Chris Szymansky](https://github.com/cszy), the VP of Engineering at [The Resumator](https://www.theresumator.com/), last week. The discussion was all about their high-level business strategy – where they are at, what the competition looks like at this point, what has happened since I was with them a couple of years ago and so on. It was a really interesting conversation in and of itself, and it reminded me again why I love working at technology startups. There is no doubt that including your employees on such discussions is one of the most effective ways to motivate them.

At any rate, I am obviously not going to dive into any details, but I did find one part of the talk particularly interesting. It was all about what Chris called the “[technology hype cycle](http://www.gartner.com/technology/research/methodologies/hype-cycle.jsp),” an applicable methodology established by leading information technology research and advisory company [Gartner](http://www.gartner.com/).

While the concept might have been groundbreaking when it was introduced, I think most people would agree that the cycle is now pretty intuitive. After all, it is designed to be a general framework that can be applied to most situations, and everything from startups to programming languages and hardware does seem to follow the cycle. With that said, I had never formally attached terminology to the evolution of technology, and I found that process intriguing.

The process according to Gartner is more-or-less as follows. After a potential technological breakthrough, you have a few people hacking together some proof-of-concepts which hopefully elicits a reaction in the media. As the idea gains more traction, the first stage of _Technology Trigger_ climaxes to the _Peak of Inflated Expectations_. Companies may stay up here for a little while, but at some point as implementations fail to deliver or producers simply shake out, they begin to descend towards the _Trough of Disillusionment_.

Some companies actually take a nosedive at this point which, as indicated by the whole [fail fast](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/quim-sabria/the-secret-to-startup-suc_b_5079355.html) concept, is better than a prolonged descent. Obviously the best option is to avoid the trough completely – which is definitely possible. The idea is to “build a bridge” over to the _Slope of Enlightenment_ and stabilize on the _Plateau of Productivity_ as quickly as possible. At this point, the goal for some is a nice acquisition, while others might opt to maintain the successful company they have built.
